This example shows two approaches to integrating Zep into an existing ImGui app; as a single header include, or as a library.  Zep is included as a submodule.
The base application is a simple Vulkan+SDL2+ImGui demo, using vcpkg to conveniently download the libraries required. 

To see the integration look in the following changelist to see what is required:

The process to integrate Zep should take no more than an hour or so, and Zep just requires any ImGui backend to work.  You might find life easier if you use SDL2 as your base window layer.  Any problems, please ask :)

Key Points:
- The editor.cpp/.h files abstract the interaction with Zep and contain the useful boilerplate
- The main.cpp has been modified to create/display/destroy zep by calling into the editor code.
- The font chosen works better than the default, particularly for High DPI
- This demo is scaled for High DPI; your mileage may vary ;)
- Make sure zep can find the zep.cfg to get the theming right.  The demo does this by making a #define that points to the root of the project
- Look at the defines in CMakeLists: 
    - To include Zep as a compiled library, uncomment this:
        #set (ZEP_LIB 1) 
    - The demo is designed for SDL integration:
        add_definitions(-DZEP_USE_SDL)
    - You want this define, unless you want to present a different list of files to Zep:
        add_definitions(-DZEP_FEATURE_CPP_FILE_SYSTEM)

This example is currently windows only; but Zep is cross platform and apart from setting up config/prebuild scripts on linux, the process is the same.  The main Zep repo does this along with automated builds and tests.  This is just an integration sample.

The config.bat file is setup for Visual Studio 2022; modify as appropriate.

To build:
- git submodule update --init
- Run prebuild.bat in the root directory.  This will install all the necessary packages
- Run config.bat to make the project.
- Run build.bat
